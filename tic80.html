  <h2 id="levelnotes">Playing level of programmes</h2>
  <p>
    Internal to the programmes, the levels only represent easier or harder, with lower or higher numbers respectively.
    As such they do not correspond to any approximation of Elo rating.
  </p>

  <p>
    The TIC-80 chess programmes on this page--January Chess, Coffee Chess, Chessix--likely all are in the range of 600 to 1500 Elo, probably often near to 1200 Elo.
    This is based on my own observation of them, rather than any officially gained rating.
    This makes them suitable for progressing beginners and regular club players.
    Stronger club players may find them a little weak, but may anyway enjoy playing against some of them just to see how they play.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have tried to order them on the page by those I find stronger at the top, and those I find weaker lower down.
    The exception to this is Chessix, which is probably the strongest programme here, and can be found after the regular chess games.
    It is stronger because, as it is a minichess variant, it only has to consider 36 squares on the board rather than 64, and only 24 pieces rather than 32.
  </p>
  <p>
    For stronger or weaker opposition, please try a more 'company' and less 'personal project' site, such as <a href="https://www.chess.com">chess.com</a> .
    There are also other links to off-site chess programmes lower down the page; these may be stronger or weaker than those here.
  </p>

  <h4>Limitations of the chess programmes here</h4>  
  <p>Unless otherwise stated, these chess programmes do not use neural networks, and as such will not present a robust tactical challenge, nor have whatever advantage of speed comes from using neural networks. This can be seen as being in the spirit of programming for a retro console.</p>
  <p>
    To keep the programmes reasonably fast, they are generally limited to a two ply lookahead (one full move), which is extended if the last of these is a capture or check.
    In general, the more the lookahead is allowed to extend, the exponentionally slower the thinking, so even with these extended lookaheads they are normally limited to four ply.
    These limited lookahead factors tend to make the programmes susceptible to tactical play, particularly forks.
  </p>
  <p>TIC-80 does not make available commands for export of data, because of which the chess programmes here do not allow saving or export of games.</p>

  <h4>
    Programme Quirks
  </h4>

  <p>None of these 'break' play during a game, and I consider them at a low level of priority.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Some awkwardness with the audio, particularly at start-up, but on computers with less powerful processors, this can persist and become worse. If this is the case, in those programmes where there is one, please use the onscreen button to mute the audio. This is in fact a problem with the web build of the software - efforts have been made by the people behind Tic-80 to improve this in more recent releases, and I will upgrade at some point in the future to see if this ameliorates the problem. I'm holding off on upgrading because 1. Occasional slowness has been seen in two more recent builds. 2. The current SHA256 on the Tic-80 website is not up-to-date (this is probably an oversight rather than a real security concern).</li>
    <li>The game record does not use the castling notation 'o-o' and 'o-o-o', instead indicating that the king has moved two squares, from which castling can be intuited.</li>
    <li>A new game can only be started when the programme recognises checkmate or stalemate - if the position is drawn in a manner it does not recognise, then the page must be reloaded to start a new game.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    January Chess gets its name because the majority of its programming was done in January 2023 and January 2024.
    During development it had the name 'Simple Chess' - the aim was to produce a programme that was easy to follow for less experienced programmers.
  </p>
  <p>January Chess can be played with a touch screen, with a controller, with a mouse, or with the keyboard.</p>

  <h4>
    January Chess Play Style
  </h4>
  <p>
    Its play is informed by positional tables with aspects of the Queen's Gambit or the French Defence.
    Taking it out of that comfort zone--if a computer programme can be said to have such a thing--may provide an edge - play a king's pawn or flank opening.
    Blocking the centre with pawns also seems to be reasonably effective against it.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is generally overly agressive with its queen and its bishops, and this can often be used against it in the opening to gain a few tempi.
  </p>
  <p>
    January Chess has turned out to be one of the stronger programmes I have programmed, and this is in spite of only having a maximum depth of four ply.
    It should find it difficult to meet any exchanges that require a deeper lookahead, but in practice this is barely noticeable.
    Due to its lookahead being only two ply unless there is a capture or check, it is extremely susceptible to forks.
  </p>
  <p>
    As well as material, its evaluation considers pawn proximity to the kings, and has a hand crafted bias to positions similar to the Queen's Gambit or the French Defence, although this is not often noticeable.
    These simple rules are in the spirit with which it was developed - Keep It Simple.
  </p>
  <h4>
    January Chess Features and Limitations
  </h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Takes maybe 20 seconds per move - a game should be over in ten to fifteen minutes.</li>
    <li>Correctly handles castling and en passant.</li>
    <li>Recognises checkmates and stalemates, but does not identify draw by threefold repetition or draw by the fifty move rule.</li>
    <li>Promotes to a queen, but can not underpromote - it's always a queen.</li>
    <li>Does not have an opening book, but has a positional rating system approximately distilled from positions similar to the Queen's Gambit and the French Defence.</li>
    <li>Has some flaws in its logic which leads to sometimes overly optimistic counter-attacks.</li>
    <li>Does not feature takeback or trace forwards.</li>
    <li>Has a processor greedy (blocking) algorithm - this was written to keep the programming simple, but may cause problems on underpowered processors.</li>

  <h2 id="coffeechess">Coffee Chess</h2>

  </p>
  <p>
    This version of chess, <a href="./chess2321/play.html">Coffee Chess</a> is programmed in <a href="https://www.lua.org/about.html">Lua</a> for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIC-80">TIC-80</a> environment.
    Coffee Chess gets its name from the fact that it likes to play either the c or f pawn forwards on its first move - these are the consonants in coffee.
    During development it had the name 'minichess' - the aim was to produce a short (not shortest) programme without any frills; it came to about 14k of Lua code.
    Since deciding to put it online, it has had a few frills added - a game record, slide animation, audio, buttons, mouse and touch-screen control. It now comes in at about 25k, but the core functionality is still just 14k.
  </p>
  <p>Coffee Chess can be played with a touch screen, with a controller, with a mouse, or with the keyboard.</p>

  <h4>
    Coffee Chess Play Style
  </h4>
  <p>
    Coffee Chess is defensive, looking to build up an equal number of defenders to its pieces as there are attackers.
    Most older experienced club players should be able to beat it once they get used to its idiosyncratic style of play.
    Experienced junior club players may still have difficulty beating it; to them, my advice is: after the opening, redirect some of your pieces to attack elsewhere.
  </p>
  <p>
    During play, it performs a two ply lookahead (one full move), extending the lookahead for exchanges.
    Coffee Chess' extended lookahead does not in fact have a limited ply, but only looks at the specific square on which it first began the extended lookahead; this can create a misbelief in its evaluation that the exchange has to be followed through to the last capture on that square, as well as the lesser logic flaw of ignoring other potential moves elsewhere on the board in this extended lookahead.
  </p>
  <p>
    Its evaluation of board positions looks first at material, then at position relative to the opponent's king (a presumption is made that the king has not moved during the lookahead), then considers position on the board (central and advanced squares are worth more).
    It values highly advanced pawn positions - if you look at the screenshot above you will see that--in command of the black pieces--Coffee Chess has built up a wall of five pawns.
    For its first few moves it is likely to play pawns forwards, particularly on the c and f files.
    Because it follows exchanges through to their conclusion, it is resistant against gradual build up of force against a particular pawn/piece.
    However, it is susceptible to forks and discovered attacks.

  <p>Rules for this minichess variant are the same as for normal chess, except that there is no castling, no double pawn move, and no taking en-passant. Chessix deviates from the classic Los Alamos variant in that it allows you to promote to bishops - as well as queens, rooks, and knights.</p>

  <h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation algorithm notes</h2>
  <p>
    The above programmes mostly use a variant of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">minmax algorithm</a> known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negamax">negamax</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-beta_pruning">alpha-beta pruning</a>.
    This is often made more effective by using <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Move_Ordering">move-(re)ordering</a>, so that moves which are expected to do well are examined early, hopefully saving time by making it so that other moves do not need to be examined.
  </p>
  <p>
    The evaluation algorithm for the programmes varies, but always pays attention to material first.
    Other factors may include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Proximity to the enemy king of pieces.</li>
    <li>Proximity to the enemy king of potential moves.</li>
    <li>The worth of pieces targetted by potential captures.</li>
    <li>Proximity to the other side of the board of the pawns.</li>
    <li>Proximity to the centre of the pieces and pawns.</li>
    <li>Proximity of the king to castled positions.</li>
    <li>Proximity of the king to pawns (useful for both its own guard and attacking advanced pawns).</li>
    <li>Alignment of queen, rooks, and bishops against the enemy king, and sometimes against other pieces.</li>
    <li>Position of rooks on open files and on the seventh and eighth ranks.</li>
    <li>Position of knights relative to the enemy king, based on their own unique movement.</li>
    <li>Blockades, particularly pawn against knight.</li>
    <li>Balance of number of attackers to number of defenders of pieces, and sometimes of squares.</li>
    <li>Development - are the pieces off the start line?</li>
  </ul>

  
  <h2 id="bbcmicrocomputer">BeebEm / BBC Microcomputer Chess Programme Links</h2>
  <p>
    BeebEm is an emulator for the BBC Microcomputer.
    The BBC Microcomupter was available between 1981 and 1994.
    The best chess programmes for it were those programmed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Bryant_(programmer)">Martin Bryant</a>, John Haig, and <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Chess_(David_Thompson)">David Thompson</a>.
    As these did not use neural networks, the strength was well below that of modern chess programmes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Martin Bryant's <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Colossus_Chess">Colossus 4.0</a> took part in the <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/USOCCC_1988"> Fourth United States Open Computer Chess Championship (1988)</a> and placed 3rd out of 4 entrants.
    Martin Brant's White Knight and Colossus both took part in the <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/European_MCC_1983">European Microcomputer Chess Championship</a> in 1983, placing 5th and 7th, respectively, out of 14 entrants.
    They are sure to have taken part in other similar tournaments at the time.
  </p>
  <p>
    According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_Chess">wikipedia</a> Colossus Chess 'featured time-controlled play with game clocks, an opening book with 3,000 positions, and problem-solving mode that could solve normal mates, selfmates and helpmates' and 'Uncommon for microcomputer chess programmes of the era, Colossus had a full implementation of the rules of chess, including underpromotion, the fifty-move rule, draw by repetition, and draw by insufficient material. Colossus was also able to execute all the basic checkmates, including the difficult bishop and knight checkmate'.
    From my recollection, it quickly gets its rooks into the centre of the board from where they can provide strong attacks, and it could have a search-depth of 8 plies, which for the era it was programmed in was very deep and made it strong (well, strong for something running on a home computer designed in the 1980s).
  </p>
  <p>
    As these programmes are available today to play for free, here are offsite links to BeebEm and to the listings for the chess programmes on <a href="http://www.bbcmicro.co.uk">bbcmicro.co.uk</a>.
    I have listed the programmes in approximate order of playing strength - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_Chess">Colossus</a> is the strongest of these.
    The programmes can actually be played online, but the online emulator is not as good as the downloadable BeebEm.

  <h2 id="fantasyconsoles">Fantasy Console Chess Programme Links</h2>
  <p>
    A fantasy console is an '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_video_game_console">emulator for a fictional video game console</a>'.
    Two popular examples are the <a href="">Pico-8</a> and the <a href="">Tic-80</a> (fantasy) consoles.
    A fantasy console provides a place for programmers to write retro games.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both pico-8 and Tic-80 use <a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> which can be found out about through the online version of <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html">Programming In Lua (PIL)</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is a short list of chess programmes available from the pico-8 and Tic-80 communities.
    None of them use neural networks.
    Only Quick Chessyness has an opening book.
    Pico-Checkmate and Sweezechess extend their depth of search when they notice checks or captures;
    even Remcode's AI in Sweezechess only has a depth of two plies unless it sees a check or capture,
    which can lead to it mistaking non-capturing non-checking moves for good (this is fairly standard for an old-school chess AI).
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, they are listed in order from best to worst.
    However, Pico-Checkmate (the best of them) gives a less interesting game than the others as it always plays the same moves (it has no random bias).

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=31213">Krystman's Pico Checkmate</a> (pico-8)</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=48948">Adam Howell's Quick Chessyness</a> (pico-8)</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=87297#p">MeinSweeze's SweezeChess (Remcode's bugfix version)</a> (pico-8)</li>
      <li><a href="https://tic80.com/play?cart=724">UmSingeloPugManco's Tichess</a> (Tic-80)</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=47884">Zeeph's Chess Engine</a> (pico-8)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Krystman's Pico Checkmate is a highly animated version.
    Krystman decided to make it 'juicy' graphically.
    Although probably the strongest of the fantasy console chess programmes, it does not feature an opening book and has no random bias added to the moves so will always play the same moves - which means it doesn't give a good variety of game.
    For me it's also a little too juicy - I find the movement of the cursor (the hand) to be distracting, but I suspect most people will not have a problem with this.
  </p>
  <p>
    Adam Howell's Quick Chessyness is something of a pleasure to play against.
    It has an opening book (the only one of these fantasy console offerings to feature this), is generally quick to make its moves, tries to avoid exchanges, and has some positional grasp.
    It will also find checkmates more easily than Pico Checkmate.
    It still makes mistakes, but for enjoyment this one might come out in top place.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have given the permalink to Remcode's version of MeinSweeze's Sweezechess - it includes a number of important bugfixes and additional AI levels.
    Remcode's version is otherwise found some way down the comments for the original listing by MeinSweeze, and is easily missed, which is a shame, as its improvements are essential.
    For variety of AI, this one comes out on top - MeinSweeze included an entirely random AI, as well as two slightly better AI, and remcode has added more to that with deeper depths of search (though the deeper they look the slower they get).
    The original version is at the top of the page, and its play is erratic because of the bugs.
    About the only two bugs remcode's version hasn't fixed are the not-quite-white-noise and a minor bug about getting out of check with an en-passant capture; it also adds a visual bug when playing as black regarding the placement of the line it is thinking about (whereas-as white-it places this extra information in very sensible places).
    There is also a crashing bug when the programme switches between some AI (something to do with the way MeinSweeze has coded one of the lower AI, I think).
    These bugs are very minor (but turn your sound off when playing this one).

    I cannot recommend Tichess - the programmer has made some unusual design choices that do not work well.
    In particular, the game plays left to right (this will be fine on a tablet lying on a table perhaps), and the pieces have no border making them a little tricky to discern - particularly the black pieces on black squares and the white pieecs on white squares.
    It also features a flashing cursor that I find distracting, although it is at least in keeping with the 'retro' idea of the fantasy consoles.
    In spite of these design problems, games against it can be quite enjoyable, and give a good opportunity to practise combinations leading to checkmates.

    Zeeph's Chess Engine is particularly weak and should not present much of a challenge to anyone but a beginner at chess once its playing style is familiar.

  <h2 id="tic80">TIC-80 notes and limitations</h2>
  <p>
      <a href="https://tic80.com/"">TIC-80</a> is 'a free and open-source fantasy video game console for making, playing, and sharing games on a limited platform that mimics the 8-bit systems of the 1980s.' (Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIC-80">wikipedia</a>)
  </p>
  <p>
      A variety of programming languages can be used with TIC-80, amongst them the easy to use <a href="https://www.lua.org/about.html">Lua</a>, which is what the programmes here use.
  </p>
  <h4>Limitations of TIC-80</h4>
  <p>'As a fantasy console, TIC-80 has some set limitations in terms of graphics and processing power in order to create a "retro-styled" gaming experience. These limitations include a 240x136 display; a 16 color palette; 256 8x8 sprites; and 4-channel sound.'<br />(Source: wikipedia. Date of access: 6th September 2023)</p>
  <p>TIC-80 programmes run in an emulated environment. This can make them slower than programmes/apps which run natively on a computer. Furthermore, TIC-80 programmes for the web run on top of a browser that uses JavaScript, and as such will be slower still.</p>

    A retro downhill slalom game. Avoid the trees and rocks. Ski close to the flags to get points.

  <p>
    I've included this here just for a break from chess.
    Because sometimes a break is needed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hint: You want where your feet meet the skis to be just above where the flag meets the ground to score a point for the flag. This can be a little tricky at first.

  <p>Skier uses only two keys, the left and right cursor keys.</p>
