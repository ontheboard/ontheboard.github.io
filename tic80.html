  <h2>TIC-80</h2>
  <p>
    This page is the index for a few chess programs for the TIC-80 emulator, and perhaps some other programs too.
  </p>
  <p>
      <a href="https://tic80.com/"">TIC-80</a> is 'a free and open-source fantasy video game console for making, playing, and sharing games on a limited platform that mimics the 8-bit systems of the 1980s.' (Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIC-80">wikipedia</a>)
  </p>
  <p>
      A variety of programming languages can be used with TIC-80, amongst them the easy to use <a href="https://www.lua.org/about.html">Lua</a>, which is what the programs here use.
  </p>
  <h4>Limitations of TIC-80</h4>
  <p>'As a fantasy console, TIC-80 has some set limitations in terms of graphics and processing power in order to create a "retro-styled" gaming experience. These limitations include a 240x136 display; a 16 color palette; 256 8x8 sprites; and 4-channel sound.'<br />(Source: wikipedia. Date of access: 6th September 2023)</p>
  <p>TIC-80 programs run in an emulated environment. This can make them slower than programs/apps which run natively on a computer. Furthermore, TIC-80 programs for the web run on top of a browser that uses JavaScript, and as such will be slower still.</p>

  <h4>Limitations of the chess programs here</h4>  
  <p>Unless otherwise stated, these chess programs do not use neural networks, and as such will not present a robust tactical challenge, nor have whatever advantage of speed comes from using neural networks. This can be seen as being in the spirit of programming for a retro console.</p>
  <p>TIC-80 does not make available commands for export of data, because of which the chess programs here do not allow saving or export of games.</p>

  <h2>Chessix</h2>
  <p>

  <p><a href="./chessix/play.html">Chessix</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Alamos_chess">Los Alamos</a> style <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minichess">Minichess</a> variant, played on a six by six square board, programmed in <a href="https://www.lua.org/about.html">Lua</a> for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIC-80">TIC-80</a> environment.</p>
  <p>Rules for this minichess variant are the same as for normal chess, except that there is no castling, no double pawn move, and no taking en-passant. Chessix deviates from the classic Los Alamos variant in that it allows you to promote to bishops - as well as queens, rooks, and knights.</p>
  <p>Chessix can be played with a touch screen, with a controller, with a mouse, or with the keyboard.</p>
  <h4>Chessix keyboard controls</h3>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>key</th><th>action</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>cursor keys</td><td>movement on the board</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>z</td><td>select a piece<br />select square to move selected piece to</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>x</td><td>rotate the board</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>a</td><td>take-back</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>s</td><td>trace-forwards</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>These keys correspond to functions for the first four buttons of a controller.</p>
  <h4>Chessix level summary</h4>
  <p>Chessix has five levels, of which level 1 is the easiest and level 5 the hardest (and slowest). Levels 4 and 5 are not recommended due to the slow play - if you choose to play against this high a level, I recommend you plug your device in to charge.</p>
