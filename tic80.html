  <h2>TIC-80</h2>
  <p>
      <a href="https://tic80.com/"">TIC-80</a> is 'a free and open-source fantasy video game console for making, playing, and sharing games on a limited platform that mimics the 8-bit systems of the 1980s.' (Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIC-80">wikipedia</a>)
  </p>
  <p>
      A variety of programming languages can be used with TIC-80, amongst them the easy to use <a href="https://www.lua.org/about.html">Lua</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
      Presented here are a few chess programs for the TIC-80 emulator, and perhaps some other programs too.

  <h3>Chessix</h3>
  <p><a href="./chessix/play.html">Chessix</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Alamos_chess">Los Alamos</a> style <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minichess">Minichess</a> variant, played on a six by six square board, programmed in <a href="https://www.lua.org/about.html">Lua</a> for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIC-80">TIC-80</a> environment.</p>
  <p>Rules for this minichess variant are the same as for normal chess, except that there is no castling, no double pawn move, and no taking en-passant. Chessix deviates from the classic Los Alamos variant in that it allows you to promote to bishops - as well as queens, rooks, and knights.</p>
  <p>Chessix can be played with a touch screen, with a controller, with a mouse, or with the keyboard. The keyboard uses the cursor keys to move about the squares, 'z' to select a piece or select where to move it to, 'x' to flip the board, and 'a' and 's' to move back and forwards through the moves already made. These keys correspond to functions for the first four buttons of a controller.</p>
  <p>Chessix has five levels, of which level 1 is the easiest and level 5 the hardest (and slowest). Levels 4 and 5 are not recommended due to the slow play - if you choose to play against this high a level, I recommend you plug your device in to charge.</p>

  <h4>Limitations of Chessix</h4>
  <p>Chessix is running in an emulated environment, using Lua code, on top of a browser that uses JavaScript, and as such it will be slower than many chess programs.</p>
  <p>Chessix does not use neural networks, and as such will not present a robust tactical challenge, nor have whatever advantage of speed comes from using neural networks.</p>
  <p>TIC-80 does not make available commands for export of data, because of which Chessix does not allow saving or export of games.</p>
