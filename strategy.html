        <p>This page still under construction. Thank you for your patience.</p>

        <p>Strategies differ from tactics in that they are not normally going to yield immediate material reward. They are long term methods of good play. The strategy chosen should be appropriate to what resources are on hand in the position, and whether or not they seem likely to be able to implement the strategy quickly enough to avoid the opponent's attempts to either counter it or to implement their own strategy.</p>
        <p>Because tactics represent a quick win of material, when there is the opportunity for them on the board, they normally take precedence over longer term strategy.</p>

        <h2>Develop your pieces</h2>
        <p></p>

        <h2>Protect against the opponent's threats</h2>
        <p></p>

        <h2>Counter-attack</h2>
        <p></p>

        <h2>Go for the King</h2>
        <p></p>

        <h2>Destroy the King's guards</h2>
        <p></p>

        <h2>Occupy the centre</h2>
        <p></p>

        <h2>Control the centre</h2>
        <p></p>

        <h2>Advance the flank Pawns</h2>
        <p></p>

        <h2>Advance the central Pawns</h2>
        <p></p>

        <h2>Restrain Pawns to prevent advances</h2>
        <p></p>

        <h2>Blockade Pawns to prevent advances</h2>
        <p></p>

        <h2>Cramp the enemy</h2>
        <p></p>

        <h2>Push for a Pawn promotion</h2>
        <p></p>

        <h2>Open up a file or files</h2>
        <p></p>

        <h2>Open up a diagonal</h2>
        <p></p>

        <h2>Plot the Knight's route</h2>
        <p>Ask where your knight would be well placed. Then work out possible routes for it to get there.</p>

        <h2>Disrupt the opponent's Pawns</h2>
        <p></p>

        <h2>Gain a Pawn superiority on one wing</h2>
        <p></p>

        <h2>Protect unprotected pieces</h2>
        <p></p>

        <h2>Provide escape squares</h2>
        <p></p>

        <h2>Target unprotected pieces</h2>
        <p></p>

        <h2>Align pieces for later tactical play</h2>
        <p>Queens, rooks, and bishops all benefit from this strategy.</p>
        <p>The tactics we are interested in are pins, skewers, and discovered attacks.</p>
        <p>The alignment of the pieces might be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pointing at or near the king.</li>
            <li>Pointing along a line on which there are many enemy pieces.</li>
            <li>Pointing along a line currently closed by a pawn which may have the opportunity to advance.</li>
            <li>Pointing along a line currently closed by a piece which can move somewhere to either attack or capture another piece.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The more unprotected pieces you can point at, the better. The more threatening the move with which an intervening piece can open the line, the better.</p>
        <p>It is good to line bishops up to target everything other than bishops and queens; bishops can target queens when they themselves are protected.</p>
        <p>It is good to line rooks up to target everything other than rooks and queens; rooks can target queens when they themselves are protected.</p>
        <p>It is good to line queens up to target everything other than bishops along diagonals, rooks along ranks and files, and queens; queens can target bishops along ranks and files, and can target rooks along diagonals without themselves being threatened.</p>
        <p>When a discovered attack with the moving piece giving check can be played, the piece that has the discovered attack does not need protection.</p>
