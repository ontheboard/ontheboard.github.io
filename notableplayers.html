        <!-- General notable players -->

        <h2>John Leonard Watson</h2>
        <p>John Watson is an American chess author of a large number of books that communicate ideas very clearly. Many of them are on chess openings. He has been an International Master since 1979.</p>

        <h2>Mark Dvoretsky</h2>
        <p>December 9, 1947 - September 26, 2016</p>
        <p>Russian chess teacher, author of many well regarded books, amongst them <i>Attack and Defence</i> (1998) and <i>Dvoretsky's Endgame Manual</i> (2003). His books have had reprints from two major chess publishers.</p>

        <h2>Leonid Stein</h2>
        <p>1934 - 1973</p>
        <p>Ukrainian champion 1960-1962</p>
        <p>Stein was the strongest player never to (have been allowed to) participate in a Candidates' Tournament.</p>

        <h2>Vladimir Vuković</h2>
        <p>26 August 1898 - 18 November 1975</p>
        <p>Croatian author of the classic <i>The Art of Attack in Chess</i> (Oxford-London 1963).</p>

        <h2>Aron Nimzowitsch</h2>
        <p>7 November 1886 - 16 March 1935</p>
        <p>Amongst the best chess players in the world, he never managed to find funding for a World Championship bid; this was at a time when the challenger had to provide sufficient funds to interest the reigning World Champion enough to put the title on the line. Perhaps he could have been World Champion, but not if he had to play Capablanca, against whom he failed to score victories.</p>
        <p>Along with Réti and Tartakower, Nimzowitsch was one of the pioneers of the hypermodern style of play. He wrote three books on chess strategy, two of which are classics of chess literature <i>My System</i> (1925) and <i>Praxis of My System</i> (1929).</i> The third book, <i>The Blockade</i> (1925) goes over ideas already covered in <i>My System</i>. Nimzowitsch's <i>My System</i> is perhaps the most influential chess book of all time, notable for founding or developing principles of blockade, prophylaxis, and overprotection.</p>

        <h2>Richard Réti</h2>
        <p>28 May 1889 - 6 June 1929</p>
        <p>One of the pioneers of the hypermodern style of play of the early 20th century.</p>
        <p>Defeated Capablanca in 1924, breaking an eight year run without a loss for the World Champion. Probably could have become World Champion, but died young (from Scarlet Fever) before he could take the title.</p>
        <p>Author of <i>Masters of the Chess Board</i> (1933), which delves into the development of chess and the openings.</p>

        <h2>Siegbert Tarrasch</h2>
        <p></p>

        <h2>Adolf Anderssen - Unofficial World Champion, circa 1851 to 1866</h2>
        <p></p>

        <h2>Howard Staunton - Unofficial World Champion, circa 1843 to 1851</h2>
        <p>Staunton held the Sicilian Defence in very high regard.</p>

        <h2>Alexander Dmitrievich Petrov</h2>
        <p>February 12, 1794 - April 22, 1867</p>
        <p>Author of the first chess handbook in Russian.</p>
        <p>Petrov's Defence (or the Russian Defence) is named after him.</p>

        <h2>François-André Danican Philidor</h2>
        <p>7 September 1726 - 31 August 1795</p>
        <p>Well known French musical composer, widely regarded as the best chess player of his time.</p>
        <p>Author of <i>Analyse du jeu des Échecs</i> (1749), which is notable for its discussion of the handling of pawns, with which Philidor took a huge step forwards from his contemporaries.</p>
        <p>'pawns ... are the soul of chess: it is they alone that determine the attack and the defense, and the winning or losing of the game depends entirely on their good or bad arrangement.' (Abbreviated translation from Philidor's <i>Analyse du jeu des Échecs</i>.)</p>

        <h2>Ruy López</h2>
        <p>Circa 1530 to circa 1580</p>
        <p>A Spanish chess player and priest. His full name was <i>Rodrigo López de Segura</i>.</p>
        <p>For a long while the opening, the Ruy López (sometimes now called the Spanish Game), which is named after him, was the opening which was held to give the player with the white pieces the most chance of victory. He contributed to the theory of this opening and the King's Gambit, amongst others.</p>
        <p>Ruy López was the author of <i> Libro de la invención liberal y Arte del juego del Axedrez</i> (1561). He was the strongest Spanish player of his time.</p>
        <p>Soltis (1947 to present day) has stated, 'he may deserve the title of world champion, but that title did not exist until the late nineteenth century'. H.J.R. Murray (1868-1955) has indicated that López's analysis in the second book of his treatise was a forerunner of the strong pawn play which Philidor would later elucidate in his <i>Analyse du jeu des Échecs</i>.</p>
