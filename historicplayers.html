        <h2>Adolf Anderssen - Unofficial World Champion, circa 1851 to 1866</h2>
        <p>Adolf Anderssen was the winner of the first international chess tournament, which was held in London in 1851, and which was organised by Howard Staunton. After this many regarded him as the World Champion.</p>
        <p>Even before the tournament, 'two commentators wrote that the winner should be regarded as "the World's Chess Champion"; one was Captain Hugh Alexander Kennedy, one of the tournament's organizers and competitors, while the other was the Liberty Weekly Tribune in Missouri.' (Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_1851_chess_tournament">wikipedia</a>.)</p>

        <h2>Howard Staunton - Unofficial World Champion, circa 1843 to 1851</h2>
        <p>April 1810 - 22 June 1874</p>
        <p>In his own time, after defeating the leading French master Pierre Charles Fournier de Saint-Amant, Howard Staunton was called by some British contemporaries the World Champion.</p>
        <p>Staunton style chess pieces are named after Howard Staunton, though in fact they were designed by the editor of the <i>Illustrated London News</i>, Nathaniel Cooke; Staunton wrote a chess column for the newspaper, and Cooke asked him to promote the chess set. Staunton signed each box of playing pieces, and received a royalty on each chess set sold. The pieces themselves were manufactured by Jacques of London, who are still extant.</p>
        <p>In 1844, Staunton caught pneumonia while travelling to play abroad, and nearly died. After this he had problems with his heart, and in 1853 had to abandon a match against the great German player, Baron von der Lasa. Baron von der Lasa considered Staunton's health not good enough for a serious contest from 1853 onwards. Staunton abandoned the competitive practice of chess in the 1850s, partly due to his health, partly due to work committments. In 1858 Staunton declined a match against Morphy on grounds of ill health, but upon being pressed by Morphy who had come to Europe to play against Europe's masters, agreed with the proviso that he could find enough time to 'get back into practise on openings and endgames'. Staunton never got into form, and his health was further worsened by his efforts to play competitive chess.</p>
        <p>The difficulties in arranging a match against Morphy, which were caused by Staunton trying - as per the proviso - to get into form, were mentioned in a book by Morphy's assistant Edge, which had (putting it politely) a strong bias against Staunton. Against that bias stand the facts that Staunton was ill and a proviso had been agreed and not met. Most controversy and negative opinion on this matter can be traced to Edge, and his defamatory book.</p>
        <p>In 1847 Staunton published <i>The Chess-Player's Handbook</i>, based on von der Lasa's <i>Handbuch</i> of 1843, but with extra material added by Staunton - it has over 300 pages of openings and almost 100 pages of endgames. The endgame material is still relevant, and the openings useful in helping understand how the modern mainlines have developed.</p>
        <p>Staunton held the Sicilian Defence in very high regard, and the English Opening gets its name from his use of it against de Saint-Amant. For his era, Staunton's style of play was very modern. He was also a great opening and endgame theorist.</p>
        
        <h2>Tassilo, Baron von Heydebrand und der Lasa</h2>
        <p>17 October 1818, Berlin - 27 July 1899</p>
        <p>The best German chess player of his era, who was unable to attend the first international chess tournament in 1851, otherwise he would likely have been the winner.</p>
        <p>He was the main author of <i>Handbuch des Schachspiels</i> (1843) which was an important opening reference for decades.</p>
        <p>Known as 'von der Lasa' as that is how he signed letters.</p>

        <h2>Alexander Dmitrievich Petrov</h2>
        <p>February 12, 1794 - April 22, 1867</p>
        <p>Author of the first chess handbook in Russian.</p>
        <p>Petrov's Defence (or the Russian Defence) is named after him.</p>

        <h2>François-André Danican Philidor</h2>
        <p>7 September 1726 - 31 August 1795</p>
        <p>Well known French musical composer, widely regarded as the best chess player of his time.</p>
        <p>Author of <i>Analyse du jeu des Échecs</i> (1749), which is notable for its discussion of the handling of pawns, with which Philidor took a huge step forwards from his contemporaries.</p>
        <p>'pawns ... are the soul of chess: it is they alone that determine the attack and the defense, and the winning or losing of the game depends entirely on their good or bad arrangement.' (Abbreviated translation from Philidor's <i>Analyse du jeu des Échecs</i>.)</p>

        <h2>Ruy López</h2>
        <p>Circa 1530 to circa 1580</p>
        <p>A Spanish chess player and priest. His full name was <i>Rodrigo López de Segura</i>.</p>
        <p>For a long while the opening, the Ruy López (sometimes now called the Spanish Game), which is named after him, was the opening which was held to give the player with the white pieces the most chance of victory. He contributed to the theory of this opening and the King's Gambit, amongst others.</p>
        <p>Ruy López was the author of <i> Libro de la invención liberal y Arte del juego del Axedrez</i> (1561). He was the strongest Spanish player of his time.</p>
        <p>Soltis (1947 to present day) has stated, 'he may deserve the title of world champion, but that title did not exist until the late nineteenth century'. H.J.R. Murray (1868-1955) has indicated that López's analysis in the second book of his treatise was a forerunner of the strong pawn play which Philidor would later elucidate in his <i>Analyse du jeu des Échecs</i>.</p>
