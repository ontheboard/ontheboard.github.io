# ontheboard.github.io
This is a personal website - as opposed to a project or an organisation site.

It's mostly about chess, for which I have programmed a number of retro non-neural-network programs.
Those here are programmed in Lua for the TIC-80 environment. For the AI they use a minmax algorithm with alpha-beta programming.
From the TIC-80 page, there is a link through to information about programming such chess programs.

The main part of the site is about chess, which I play at my local library chess club.
The introduction to the game here is planned to be largely accessible to screen-readers.
As such the text on the page goes a long way to describing the game, even though graphics would make it clearer for the seeing; graphics are anyway planned to be included.
Whether the choice of table elements as representations of the board is particularly accessible is another matter.
It's early days (September 2023), and I hope to find better ways to make it more accessible.
