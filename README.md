This is a personal website - as opposed to a project or an organisation site.

It's mostly about chess, for which I have programmed a number of retro non-neural-network programs.
Those here are programmed in Lua for the TIC-80 environment. For the AI they use a minmax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.
From the TIC-80 page, there is a link through to information about programming such chess programs.

The main part of the site is about chess, which I play at my local library chess club.
