        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            A few books are in <b>bold</b>, these are ones that are often mentioned favourably by other chess writers. Which is not to say others aren't also mentioned, but these ones seem to stand out, even amongst the others.
        </p>
        <p>
            The distribution of works into basics, chess classics, and openings is clear and would not be disagreed with by most people interested in chess literature. The distribution of works into modern works and modern classics is less clear, and more a matter of personal taste.
        </p>
        <p>
            The order of books in each section is by year of the most recent publication, except for 'chess classics' which is by year of the original publication, and 'development of the chess openings' which is by year of relevance (there being one publication which covers an early era but was printed very recently).
        </p>
        <p>
            I have not read all the books, and have gone by my impression of 1. the authors, 2. sample pages, 3. the blurb, 4. the reviews, in approximately that order. This is not a review page.
        </p>

        <h2>Reputable Publishers</h2>

            Hardinge and Simpole, Gambit, Batsford, Quality Chess, and Everyman are British publishers.
            Edition Olms is a German publisher. Thinkers Publishing is a Belgium company.
            The rest - Dover, Ishi, Russell Enterprises, McFarland, New in Chess - are American publishers.
            <br />
            This can make a difference - particularly for the reprint of older works - as to what edition you actually get hold of.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Books from these publishers are available from many general online bookshops, as well as specific chess shops such as <a href="https://chess.co.uk/collections/chess-books">chess.co.uk</a>

        <h2>Authors not featured here</h2>
        <p>
            The most prolific modern authors not featued on this page appear to be:
            Raymond Keene, who was left disgraced after perhaps two accusations of plagiarism and one of embezzlement,
            the latter from his brother-in-law David Levy.
            
            Not mentioned on this page are the prolific writers Karsten Müller, Cyrus Lakdawala, Carsten Hansen, and Andrew Soltis.
            I have given these names in order of those I consider good to not so good.
            
            The most mentioned author (in reviews) seems to be Jeremy Silman,
            although the book he is mentioned for has been completely rewritten,
            which many feel is to its detriment,
            which makes it/him not worth mentioning here.

            Short guides for those who don't yet know how to play chess. Any of them will do, most are quite short, but Eade's 'Bible' is a little more substantial.

        <h2>Chess classics</h2>
        <p>
            These were originally published in descriptive notation.
            For example, 'king's pawn to king's fourth' rather than 'e2-e4'.
            The <i>Dover Chess</i> series from Dover Publications still makes them available in the old descriptive notation.
            The main modern publishers of them are Hardinge & Simpole, Dover Publications, Russell Enterprises, and Ishi.
            I believe that Russell Enterprises and Ishi have been updating some of them to use algebraic notation.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are looking for a copy of any of these, try to only purchase editions from a reputable publisher (listed above) - many inferior copies have been published recently (for example, one edition of Capablanca's work was published without any chess diagrams, making the book unusable). Read the comments from reviewers if these are available on the site you are purchasing from.
        </p>

            Scroll down for modern classics.

        <h2>Modern Classics</h2>
        <p>
            These were published either this century or late enough in the 20th century to all use algebraic notation, such as 'e2-e4'.
            Either these specific books are well established as classics, or the authors are of particular note.
            As far as I know, these are all still available, some with a more recent year of publication than those given here - with many I have given the year when I believe they were first published; if one of the titles catches your attention, look for the most recent publication of it, rather than going by the years given here.

            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>The Development of the Chess Openings</h2>
        <p>
            This is a small selection of books from the late 19th and early 20th century which give a wide enough basis of the openings for an interested reader to trace their development; those in bold are ones I think more suited to such a purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
            None of these are 'essential reading' for a modern player - they are instead for those interested in the history of the openings. For modern players, van der Sterren's work listed above is a guide to how the openings are played in the modern era.
        </p>
        <p>
            As far as I know, most of the following (except Tartakower's book, and Utterberg's modern book on the 1834 match) are only available in the old descriptive notation, such as 'king's pawn to king's fourth'.

                    Chess Openings for Beginners - the Rev. E.E. Cunnington (1900)<br />
                    The Rev. Cunnington's original book, before the Du Mont revision, is available on Google books; I find its style nearly unreadable. The revised 1951 edition, although still in descriptive notation, is much more readable.
                </li>
                <li><b>The Chess-Player's Handbook - Howard Staunton (1847)</b> 
                    <br />
                    Caution: There are many American editions of this that are not in fact the original book published by Staunton.
                    This includes most of the scanned e-book versions of this, and as far as I can tell the 2009 Ishi Press edition (Ishi Press are an American publisher).
                    This is significant if you want to look at the openings in the form that Staunton gave them.
                    <br />
                    Hardinge and Simpole, in their <a href="http://www.hardingesimpole.co.uk/series/hardinge_simpole_chess_classics.htm">chess classics</a> range, list the Chess Player's Handbook at £24.95 - I presume this is a facsimile of the original and not one of the American editions which are only 'based on the Chess Player's Handbook by My Staunton'.
                    <br />
                    Older publications of Staunton's book can be found second-hand - it was published by Batsford Books in 1985, reprinted in hardback in 1989 by Bracken books, and in paperback in 1995 by Senate, an imprint of Studio Editions Ltd.
                    In September 2023 I can find older hardbacks of it for £11, the Bracken books hardback for just over £20, and the Senate paperback for a ridiculous price of more than £40.
                <li>
                    De La Bourdonnais Versus McDonnell, 1834 - Cary Utterberg (2012) Published by McFarland & Co
                    <br />
                    For the oldest look at the opening, we come to the most recent book listed in this section.
                    The 85 games of this early chess match were recorded by  William Greenwood Walker.
                    What is notable about this match (apart from the skill of the two players, who were likely the best in the world at the time) is that as they played, they developed opening theory.
                    One notable piece of trivia is that after losing against the King's Gambit, La Bourdonnais as black switched to answering 1.e2-e4 with 1. ... c7-c5 instead of 1. ... e7-e5.
                    By playing the Sicilian Defence, he avoided the King's Gambit entirely.
                    <br />
                    If you're interested in chess openings of the 19th century and can't get hold of a copy of Staunton's Handbook, this would be a decent tournament-approach (lacking in variation-breadth) alternative.
                    There are other similar books of early games available, often also published by McFarland & Company.
