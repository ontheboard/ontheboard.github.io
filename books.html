        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            A few books are in <b>bold</b>, these are ones that are often mentioned favourably by other chess writers. Which is not to say others aren't also mentioned, but these ones seem to stand out, even amongst the others.
        </p>
        <p>
            The distribution of works into basics, chess classics, and openings is clear and would not be disagreed with by most people interested in chess literature. The distribution of works into modern works and modern classics is less clear, and more a matter of personal taste.
        </p>
        <p>
            The order of books in each section is by year of the most recent publication, except for chess classics which is by year of the original publication.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have not read all the books, and have gone by my impression of 1. the authors, 2. sample pages, 3. the blurb, 4. the reviews, in approximately that order. This is not a review page.
        </p>
        <p>
            Chess books are available from many general online bookshops, as well as specific chess shops such as <a href="https://chess.co.uk/collections/chess-books">chess.co.uk</a>
        </p>

        <h2>Reputable Publishers</h2>
        <p>
            The 'chess classics' section lists books of historic importance, most of which are still available today, either from:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dover Publications</li>
            <li>Russell Enterprises</li>
            <li>Ishi</li>
            <li>Edition Olms</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Newer books are also available from some of these, as well as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gambit</li>
            <li>Batsford Chess</li>
            <li>Everyman Chess (who also publish books previously published by Cadogan)</li>
            <li>New in Chess</li>
            <li>Chessable</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Basics</h2>
        <p>
            Short guides for those who don't yet know how to play chess. Any of them will do, most are quite short, but Eade's 'Bible' is a little more substantial.
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Chess for Children - Murray Chandler, Helen Milligan (2023, 2004)</li>
                <li>The Batsford Book of Chess for Children - Sabrina Chevannes (New edition 2022)</li>
                <li>Chess for Beginners - Michael Basman (2021)</li>
                <li>The Usborne Chess Book (Activity Books): 1 - Lucy Bowman (2016)</li>
                <li>Chess Player's Bible - James Eade, Al Lawrence (2015)</li>
                <li>The Usborne Complete Book of Chess: 1 - Elizabeth Dalby (2014)</li>
                <li>Chess for Kids: How to Play and Win - Richard James (2010)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        
        <h2>Chess classics</h2>
        <p>
            These were originally published in descriptive notation. For example, 'e2-e4' would be described as 'king's pawn to king's fourth'. The <i>Dover Chess</i> series from Dover Publications still makes them available in the old descriptive notation. The main modern publishers of them are Dover Publications, Russell Enterprises, Ishi, and Edition Olms. I believe that Russell Enterprises and Ishi have been updating some of them to use algebraic notation.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are looking for a copy of any of these, try to only purchase editions from a reputable publisher (listed above) - many inferior copies have been published recently (for example, one edition of Capablanca's work was published without any chess diagrams, making the book unusable). Read the comments from reviewers if these are available on the site you are purchasing from.
        </p>

        <h2>Modern Classics</h2>
        <p>
            These were published either this century or late enough in the 20th century to all use algebraic notation, such as 'e2-e4'.
            Either these specific books are well established as classics, or the authors are of particular note.
            As far as I know, these are all still available, some with a more recent year of publication than those given here - with many I have given the year when I believe they were first published; if one of the titles catches your attention, look for the most recent publication of it, rather than going by the years given here.
