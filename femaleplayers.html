        <h2>She Plays To Win</h2>
        <p>
            Women in chess are under-represented. Lorin D'Costa in 'She Plays to Win' wrote about this:
            <br /><br />
            <blockquote>
                'My older sister Emma used to (does still?) take great delight in defeating me at golf, tennis and other games and sports.
                She even used to play chess, until she declared age ll 'that it could be your thing'.
                That was very generous of her :-&#x0029;.
                <br /><br />
                Certainly playing for her women's football team, I saw stigma attached to this.
                Back in the 1990s football was seen as a 'boys thing' and these girls were trying to break this image.
                Why couldn't they get involved too?
                <br /><br />
                As I write in 2021 we can see huge changes have been made.
                Women's football amongst other sports, are very popular.
                In terms of chess, however, it is still unclear.
                <br /><br />
                This one has confused me as I have been a full time chess coach for around 15 years.
                Chess is not a physical game, and hence I refer you back to the quote by Susan Polgar
                ['If we talk about pure abilities and skills, I believe there should be no reason why women cannot play as well as men.']
                - why on earth should girls not play chess as much as boys?'
                <br />

            Without further ado, there follow the short biographies of just a few of the talented women who do play chess. 
        </p>
        
        <!-- Women's World Champions and Judit and Sofia -->

        <h2>Jū Wénjūn</h2>
        <p>Women's World Champion since 2018. She has successfully defended her title in 2018, 2020, and 2023.</p>
        <p>Wénjūn plays for the Shanghai Chess Club. In 2017 she achieved a peak rating of 2604.</p>
        <p>With the white pieces she most often plays 1. d2-d4. With the black pieces she often plays either a Najdorf Sicilian, a King's Indian Defence, or a Nimzo-Indian Defence.</p>

        <h2>Phiona Mutesi</h2>
        <p>The subject of the book and the film <i>Queen of Katwe</i>, Phiona is a Women Candidate Master with a peak rating of 1686.</i></p>
        <p>Phiona was born in Uganda in the Katwe neighbourhood of Kampala. Her family were very poor and unable to afford to send her to school after the age of nine.</p>
        <p>Phiona and her fellow Ugandan Ivy Amoko were the first titled female players in Ugandan history, both achieving the title of Woman Candidate Master at the 40th Chess Olympiad in Istanbul in 2012.</p>

        <h2>Zsuzsa Polgár</h2>
        <p>One of three Hungarian sisters ranked very highly.</p>
        <p>
            Zsuzsa (Susan) was Women's World Chess Champion from 1996 to 1999.
            She would have held the title for longer but a dispute with FIDE about the playing conditions of a delayed title-encounter led to them declaring that she had forfeited her title.
            After this she chose to no longer participate in Women's World Championship candidate cycles.
        </p>
        <p>In January 1991 Zsuzsa became a Grandmaster, the youngest woman ever to achieve this.</p>
        <p>In 1985, at the age of 15, Zsuzsa had achieved the Grandmaster norm eleven times, but because she was in conflict with the Hungarian Chess Federation because she played in men's tournaments and not in women's tournaments, she was not awarded the title, and remained as International Master for another six years.</p>
        <p>Zsuzsa became the top-ranked female player in 1984 at the age of 15.</p>


        <h2>Judit Polgár </h2>
        <p>One of three Hungarian sisters ranked very highly. Judit is widely regarded as the strongest female player of all time, having a peak rating of 2735. Judit has never competed for the Women's World Championship.</p>
        <p>Judit has had victories against Magnus Carlsen, Anatoly Karpov, Garry Kasparov, Vladimir Kramnik, Boris Spassky, Vasily Smyslov, Veselin Topalov, Viswanathan Anand, Ruslan Ponomariov, Alexander Khalifman, and Rustam Kasimdzhanov.</p>
        <p>In 2005 Judit particpated in the FIDE World Chess Championship in Argentina. The other participants were Veselin Topalov (the eventual winner), Rustam Kasimdzhanov, Michael Adams, Péter Lékó, Viswanathan Anand, Alexander Morozevich, and Peter Svidler. Vladimir Kramnik and Garry Kasparov refused to play in this Championship because of disputes with FIDE.</p>
        <p>In 1996 she was ranked the number 10 chess player in the world.</p>
        <p>In December 1991 Judit became a grandmaster, taking her sister Zsuzsa's record to become the youngest woman ever to achieve this, and also taking Bobby Fischer's record as the youngest person to achieve this title.</p>
        <p>From January 1989 until August 2014, when she retired from competitive chess, she was the highest rated female chess player.</p>
        <p>At age 11 she defeated her first Grandmaster, Lev Gutman.</p>


        <h2>Zsófia Polgár</h2>
        <p>One of three Hungarian sisters ranked very highly. <a href="https://sofiapolgar.com/">Zsófia</a> now lives in Israel. Zsófia (Sofia) is an International Master with a peak rating of 2450.</p>
        <p>The 'Sack of Rome' or 'Miracle in Rome' refers to her winning performance with eight and a half out of nine score in a tournament in Rome in 1989 at the age of 14; the tournament included several strong grandmasters. Her performance gave her a rating for the tournament of 2900.</p>

        <!-- British Players (Female) -->

        <h2>Jovanka Houska</h2>
        <!-- Born 10 June 1980 -->
        <p>Born in South London of Czech descent, Jovanka is an International Master, with a peak rating of 2433.</p>
        <p>British and English Women's Champion 2008, defending the title from 2009 to 2012, and regaining it in 2016 to defend it in 2017, 2018, and 2019.</p>
        <p>By July 2010 she was England's second highest ranked female chess player, and the world's fifty-first highest ranked of active female chess players.</p>
        <p>In 2006 she was voted the English Chess Federation Player of the Year - the first female chess player to receive this accolade.</p>
        <p>Women's winner for the Commonwealth Championship 2001.</p>
        <p>Achieved her first Women's Grandmaster norm in 1999 at the British Championship.</p>
        <p>Her favourite opening with the black pieces is the Caro-Kann Defence, an opening on which she has written two books. She has also written a book on the Scandinavian Defence.</p>

        <h2>Vera Menchik</h2>
        <p>16 February 1906 - 26 June 1944</p>
        <p>Women's World Chess Champion from 1927 to 1944, and the first holder of the title.</p>
        <p>Vera had a positive tournament record against Max Euwe, first beating him in the Hasting's Christmas Congress in 1931, four years before he became World Champion.</p>
        <p>
            Vera had victories over the following notable male players:
            <ul>
                <li>Max Euwe (Later a World Champion.)</li>
                <li>Edgard Colle (After whom the Colle System is named.)</li>
                <li>Friedrich Sämisch (After whom the Sämisch variation of the King's Indian Defence is named.)</li>
                <li>Mir Sultan Khan (A Punjabi chess player, highly respected in Britain from 1929 to 1933 when he was active as a chess player.)</li>
                <li>Edward Jackson</li>
                <li>Harry Golombek (Later an International Master, and from 1985, an honorary Grandmaster. Golombek was a well respected chess author.)</li>
                <li>Samuel Reshevsky (A former child prodigy who at the age of (probably) 10 had played in the New York Masters tournament, and later a Grandmaster and contender for the World Chess Championship. Vera was the only player to defeat him in 1935 at the Major Open at the British Championship in Yarmouth.)</li>
                <li>Jacques Mieses (After whom variations in the Scandinavian Defence, the Vienna Game, and the Scotch Game are named, as well as the Mieses Opening 1. d2-d3.)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the Kent Congress at Ramsgate, in 1929, Vera finished in joint second for her team alongside Akiba Rubinstein, the two being beaten by only half a point by the former World Champion José Raúl Capablanca.
            During this tournament, Vera won three games, drew four, and lost none.
        </p>
        <p>With the black pieces Vera often played the French Defence and The Queen's Gambit Declined. With the white pieces she favoured Queen's Pawn's openings 1. d2-d4.</p>
        <p>
            Vera and Olga were Russian born Czechoslovak chess players with a Czech father and English mother.
            The family moved to England in 1921 because of the Russian Revolution. She and her sister, and other family members, were tragically killed in London in the penultimate year of the war by a V1 flying bomb.
        </p>

        <h2>Olga Menchik</h2>
        <p>2 May 1907 - 26 June 1944</p>
        <p>Olga Menchik was a strong chess player and sister to Vera Menchik, the first Women's World Champion.</p>
