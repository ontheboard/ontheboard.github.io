        <h2>She Plays To Win</h2>
        <p>
            Women in chess are under-represented. Lorin D'Costa in 'She Plays to Win' wrote about this:
            <br /><br />
            <blockquote>
                'My older sister Emma used to (does still?) take great delight in defeating me at golf, tennis and other games and sports.
                She even used to play chess, until she declared age ll 'that it could be your thing'.
                That was very generous of her :-&#x0029;.
                <br /><br />
                Certainly playing for her women's football team, I saw stigma attached to this.
                Back in the 1990s football was seen as a 'boys thing' and these girls were trying to break this image.
                Why couldn't they get involved too?
                <br /><br />
                As I write in 2021 we can see huge changes have been made.
                Women's football amongst other sports, are very popular.
                In terms of chess, however, it is still unclear.
                <br /><br />
                This one has confused me as I have been a full time chess coach for around 15 years.
                Chess is not a physical game, and hence I refer you back to the quote by Susan Polgar
                ['If we talk about pure abilities and skills, I believe there should be no reason why women cannot play as well as men.']
                - why on earth should girls not play chess as much as boys?'
                <br />
