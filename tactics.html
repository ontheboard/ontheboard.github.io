        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Although the overall aim in Chess is to checkmate the opponent's King, there are also short term goals, in particular to either win material or to improve your position.</p>
        <p>You win material by capturing pieces worth more than those your opponent captures.</p>
        <p>You improve your position by putting your pieces on squares where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>their range of movement is large</li>
            <li>they are threatening squares near the enemy King</li>
            <li>they are in the centre of the board (this tends to increase mobility)</li>
            <li>they are in a difficult to assault position</li>
            <li>they are well defended</li>
            <li>they are attacking the opponent's pieces or weak squares</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A number of tactics have been noted as being good for winning (or preserving) material.</p>

        <h2>Attack and defence / outnumbering</h2>
        <p>This is so basic a tactic that many introductions to chess scarcely mention it. Chess is a game of threats or potential captures. One player moves a piece to threaten an opposing piece, the other player either moves the threatened piece, blocks the attack, or captures the threatening piece, but there are two other alternatives, one of which is protection. (The other is counter-attack, which shall be covered next.)</p>
        <p>With the exception of the King, a threatened or attacked piece can be protected or defended, by moving a piece to a position where, if the opponent takes the threatened piece, a recapture could be made.</p>
        <p>When a piece of each side is captured on a square, it is termed an <b>exchange</b>. Players try to make sure that exchanges either keep the captured material level or work out in their favour.</p>
        <p>When there is a series of exchanges on one square, it can be difficult to work out who will come out ahead. Such a series of exchanges might occur because one player has moved a number of pieces to attack a particular piece (often a Pawn) and the other player has moved a number of pieces to defend the attacked piece. This is attack and defence.</p>
        <p>One of the principles that arises out of attack and defence is outnumbering. The attacking side is trying to make the number of attacking pieces affecting a square outnumber the defenders of that square, and vice versa. <b>It can sometimes be easier, rather than trying to calculate a series of exchanges, to count how many attackers and how many defenders there are for a particular square - please note though, this is sometimes a little inexact, as there may be other places on the board which will be affected by a series of exchanges.</b></p>

        <h2>Counter-attack</h2>
        <p>When a piece of yours is threatened, threaten a piece of the opponent's that is worth the same or more material value (making sure that the piece you move cannot itself be captured).</p>
