        <h2>Tactical Skills</h2>
        <p>There are just a few extra tactical skills to be aware of when seeking a checkmate, these examples demonstrate them. Most of the time what is being looked for is a forcing move - a check - that also assists by either moving the enemy pieces or by opening up a rank, file, diagonal, or square for another of your own pieces. These tactics in the general sense - rather than the specific examples here - arise frequently, so try to absorb the general ideas of ways to move the enemy pieces or create openings.</p>

        <div id="skillarea"></div>

        <h2>Key checkmate patterns</h2>
        <p>With each of the patterns, take a little while to appreciate why it is checkmate - which squares the king can't move to because of check, which squares are blocked by the king's own pieces, where the edge of the board is - and to appreciate how the pieces are coordinating to give enough control to deliver the checkmate.</p>
        <p>The patterns here are arranged by me to make them simpler to appreciate similarities. Some of them are generalised from checkmates in the book <i>Chess Calculation Training for Kids and Club Players</i> by Romain Edouard. This book aims to build up an awareness for the checkmates through presenting a number of positions from actual games with similar methods of checkmate, so the player learns to look for ways to move their pieces to bring them about. The five examples for the tactics section - see above - are from that book, but I have arranged them and given them with the sequence of moves necessary to show those checkmate tactics which I consider important. (None of the material on this page is presented in the book in the manner that it is here - this page shows the fundamentals needed to get the most from such a book.)</p>

        <h2>Back rank mates</h2>
        <div id="backrankpatternarea"></div>

        <h2>Artificial wall mates</h2>
        <p>Where two or more friendly pieces attack sufficient squares to provide a barrier impassable to the enemy king, allowing it to be checkmated as with a back rank mate. Such barriers are also useful for forcing the king's movements.</p>
        <div id="artificialwallpatternarea"></div>

        <h2>Edge file mates</h2>
        <p>Where a back-rank-like mate occurs against a side edge of the board.</p>

        <div id="upclosepatternarea"></div>

        <h2>Queen and one blocked diagonal Patterns</h2>
        <p>The protected queen delivers the mate using an edge of the board, and with the one diagonal escape square blocked, often by an enemy piece.</p>
