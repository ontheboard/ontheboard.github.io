  <h3><a href="./chessix/play.html">Chessix</a></h3>
  <p>Chessix is a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Alamos_chess">Los Alamos</a> style <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minichess">Minichess</a> variant, played on a six by six square board, programmed in <a href="https://www.lua.org/about.html">Lua</a> for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIC-80">TIC-80</a> environment.</p>
  <p>Rules for this minichess variant are the same as for normal chess, except that there is no castling, no double pawn move, and no taking en-passant. Chessix deviates from the classic Los Alamos variant in that it allows you to promote to bishops - as well as queens, rooks, and knights.</p>

  <h4>Limitations of Chessix</h4>
  <p>Chessix is running in an emulated environment, using Lua code, on top of a browser that uses JavaScript, and as such it will be slower than many chess programs.</p>
  <p>Chessix does not use neural networks, and as such will not present a robust tactical challenge, nor have whatever advantage of speed comes from using neural networks.</p>
  <p>TIC-80 does not make available commands for export of data, because of which Chessix does not allow saving or export of games.</p>
