  <h2>January 2024 Update</h2>
  <p>There were a few months at the end of 2023 when I was busy with other things and did not add to this site. As of now (January 2024) I have added the first chess programme, Coffee Chess, with plans to add the other half dozen or so over the next few months as and when they become polished just enough.</p>
  <p>There are still a lot of things to add to the site, see the 'coming soon' section above; they are still 'coming soon'.</p>
