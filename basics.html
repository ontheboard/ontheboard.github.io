        <h2>The game of chess</h2>
        <p>Chess is a game for two players. It is played on a chequered board of eight squares by eight squares. The two players alternate turns, during which they may move a piece on the board in accordance with the rules.</p>
        <p>There are six different pieces in chess. The six pieces are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>King &#9812; &#9818;</li>
            <li>Queen &#9813; &#9819;</li>
            <li>Rook &#9814; &#9820;</li>
            <li>Bishop &#9815; &#9821;</li>
            <li>Knight &#9816; &#9822;</li>
            <li>Pawn &#9817; &#9823;</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Each piece has its own unique way of moving.</b> In addition some pieces have special movement rules - castling is a special move which a King and a Rook can make together, and Pawns have a few special rules concerning them.</p>
        <p>The Queen, Rook, and Bishop all share the feature that their movement is extended in particular directions until either the edge of the board is met, one of their own pieces is met - their move stopping on the square before that piece, or one of the opponent's pieces is met - allowing the capture of that piece (so long as it isn't the King) by removing it from the square it is on and placing the capturing piece on the now empty square.</p>
        <p>In general pieces capture in the same manner that they move, but Pawns are an exception to this.</p>
        <p>It is generally easiest to gain an understanding of how the pieces moved by sitting at a board with an experienced player who is willing to work through their moves with you. Failing that there are many sites online which provide an interactive tutorial to the basic moves. This page currently only provides a description of their moves.</p>

        <p>The board is an eight by eight square chequered area. The board is set so that the lighter square goes in the right hand corner; this is valid for both players.</p>
        <p>Each player has sixteen playing pieces, which are placed one to a square. One player controls the light coloured pieces, the other player the dark coloured pieces.</p>
        <p>The board is given a coordinate system. From the perspective of the player with the light coloured pieces:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>From left to right the files are labelled: a b c d e f g h</li>
            <li>From near to far the ranks or rows are numbered: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8</li>
        </ul>
        <p>From the perspective of the player with the dark coloured pieces:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>From <b>right to left</b> the files are labelled: a b c d e f g h</li>
            <li>From near to far the ranks or rows are numbered: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This coordinate system makes it possible to record a piece's move, or to talk about a move - for example: pawn from e2 to e4.</p>
        <p>Sometimes we also refer to ranks or rows relative to the player's side of the board, so the first rank is that closest to the player, and the eighth rank that furthest from the player. Context normally makes it obvious when this relative method of talking about the ranks is used.</p>

        <h2>The King  &#9812; &#9818;</h2>
        <p>The King is represented by one of the two tallest playing pieces. Upon its top, it generally has a small cross.</p>
        <p>The King is the most important piece on the chess board. If the King is put in a position from which it may not evade capture, the game is lost.</p>
        <p>The King can move to any of the eight squares adjacent to that which it is already on, with the proviso that it cannot be put in a position where it would be in check (which is to say - it cannot be put in a position where it could be captured were the rules to allow such a capture).</p>
        <p>The King, like most pieces, captures in the same manner as it moves - if there is an opposing piece in any of the eight adjacent squares next to the King, and taking that piece will not leave the King in jeopardy, then the King can capture it with its move.</p>
        <p>Because it is illegal (against the rules) to put the King in a position where it could be captured, one King cannot be moved into a square adjacent to the opposing side's King.</p>
        <h3>Check against the King</h3>
        <p>When a piece is moved to where it could with another move capture the King - if the rules allowed that - then the King is said to be in check. The player whose King is in check is obliged with their move to either:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>move the King so it is no longer in check</li>
            <li>to block the checking piece's attack (by interposing another piece between the King and the attacking piece, on the attacking piece's line of attack)</li>
            <li>to take the piece which is giving check</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This can be summed up as: The player whose move it is cannot have their King in check at the end of their move.</p>
        <p><b>The King cannot in fact be captured. If a player makes a move which leaves their King able to be captured, that move should be reversed, or taken back.</b></p>
        <h3>Checkmate of the King</h3>
        <p>The King is said to be checkmated if a player whose King is in check can neither:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>move their King to a square where it is not in check</li>
            <li>nor block the check(s)</li>
            <li>nor take the piece which is giving check</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The player whose King has been checkmated has lost the game.</p>
        <p>Because of this, the King is the most important piece on the board, although not the most powerful.</p>
        <p><b>The three point list 'move, block, capture' is the mantra for getting the King out of trouble.</b></p>
        <p>For getting other pieces out of trouble the mantra becomes: <b>'move, block, capture, protect, counter-attack'.</b></p>
        <h3>Taking back illegal moves</h3>
        <p>Moves that leave the King in check are termed illegal moves. There are some other moves that are illegal as well - any move that moves the pieces in a way other than that which the rules permit.</p>
        <p>If a position is encountered where the King is found to have been in check for some time, then the players should take back the moves which were made in contravention of the rule that the King cannot be left in check at the end of a move, then resume play from the position where the first illegal move was made.</p>

        <h2>The Queen &#9813; &#9819;</h2>
        <p>The Queen is represented by one of the two tallest playing pieces. Upon its top, it generally has crown with multiple peaks.</p>
        <p>The Queen can move in any of the eight directions - horizontally along the ranks or rows, vertically along the files, or diagonally. She may move until she meets the edge of the board or another piece.</p>
        <p>The Queen's movement rules make her the most mobile and therefore the most (ordinarily) powerful piece on the board. <b>In chess, mobility and power often go hand in hand.</b></p>

        <h2>The Rook &#9814; &#9820;</h2>
        <p>The Rook is represented by a piece shaped like a tower. Upon its top, it generally has a few crenellations.</p>
        
        <h3>Castling with the King and a Rook</h3>

        <h2>The Bishop &#9815; &#9821;</h2>
        <p>The Bishop is represented by a fairly tall thing playing piece. Upon its top, it may have a nodule and a little lower a diagonal groove.</p>

        <h2>The Knight &#9816; &#9822;</h2>
        <p>The Knight is represented by a piece shaped like a horse. It is asymmetrical and tends to be the most decorative of pieces.</p>

        <h2>The Pawn &#9817; &#9823;</h2>
        <p>The Pawn is represented by the smallest playing piece. Each player gets eight of them.</p>


        <h3>The Pawn's two square advance</h3>
        <h3>Pawns taking Pawns <i>en passant</i></h3>
        <h3>Pawn promotion</h3>
        <h3>Pawn underpromotion</h3>

        <p>After setting up the board with the light coloured square in the right hand corner, the pieces are set up as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Pawns go on each player's second rank or row. Using the coordinate system, this means that</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>For the player with the lighter pieces, the Pawns will go on row number 2.</li>

                </ul>
            <li>The other pieces go on each player's first rank:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The Rooks go in the corners.</li>
                <li>The Knights are next inwards.</li>
                <li>The bishops next, in the squares adjacent to the centre squares.</li>
                <li>The Queen goes on her own colour square in the fourth file (this is valid for both players).</li>
                <li>The King goes on the remaining square next to the Queen.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>Through long play the early players determined approximate values of worth for the pieces relative to the worth of a Pawn. Although different players have used slightly different values, the values given in the table above are fairly standard.</p>
        <p>It is possible to roughly track how well a game is going by summing the values of the captured pieces. These values are known as their <i>material</i> worth.</p>
        <p>The King is generally said to either not have a material value (because he cannot be captured) or to be of infinite value.</p>
        <p><b>Material value isn't everything though - a piece in the centre of the board, or in a difficult to assail position from where it can easily attack, is often said to be worth more than the values given in the table.</b> Likewise a pawn on its sixth or seventh rank is well on the way to queening, and gains extra value because of this.</p>
        <p>Knights and Bishops are generally worth about the same, with Knights being marginally devalued due to their short range. However, in positions where the Pawns are locked and preventing the Bishops from finding open diagonals, the Knights are generally more mobile and more valuable. This shift in value is a matter of judgement as to which is the more useful or more mobile piece at the time.</p>
