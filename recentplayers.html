        <h2>John Leonard Watson</h2>
        <p>John Watson is an American chess author of a large number of books that communicate ideas very clearly. Many of them are on chess openings. He has been an International Master since 1979.</p>

        <h2>Mark Dvoretsky</h2>
        <p>December 9, 1947 - September 26, 2016</p>
        <p>Russian chess teacher, author of many well regarded books, amongst them <i>Attack and Defence</i> (1998) and <i>Dvoretsky's Endgame Manual</i> (2003). His books have had reprints from two major chess publishers.</p>

        <h2>Leonid Stein</h2>
        <p>1934 - 1973</p>
        <p>Ukrainian champion 1960-1962</p>
        <p>Stein was the strongest player never to (have been allowed to) participate in a Candidates' Tournament.</p>

        <h2>Vladimir Vuković</h2>
        <p>26 August 1898 - 18 November 1975</p>
        <p>Croatian author of the classic <i>The Art of Attack in Chess</i> (Oxford-London 1963).</p>

        <h2>Aron Nimzowitsch</h2>
        <p>7 November 1886 - 16 March 1935</p>
        <p>Amongst the best chess players in the world, he never managed to find funding for a World Championship bid; this was at a time when the challenger had to provide sufficient funds to interest the reigning World Champion enough to put the title on the line. Perhaps he could have been World Champion, but not if he had to play Capablanca, against whom he failed to score victories.</p>
        <p>Along with Réti and Tartakower, Nimzowitsch was one of the pioneers of the hypermodern style of play. He wrote three books on chess strategy, two of which are classics of chess literature <i>My System</i> (1925) and <i>Praxis of My System</i> (1929).</i> The third book, <i>The Blockade</i> (1925) goes over ideas already covered in <i>My System</i>. Nimzowitsch's <i>My System</i> is perhaps the most influential chess book of all time, notable for founding or developing principles of blockade, prophylaxis, and overprotection.</p>

        <h2>Richard Réti</h2>
        <p>28 May 1889 - 6 June 1929</p>
        <p>One of the pioneers of the hypermodern style of play of the early 20th century.</p>
        <p>Defeated Capablanca in 1924, breaking an eight year run without a loss for the World Champion. Probably could have become World Champion, but died young (from Scarlet Fever) before he could take the title.</p>
        <p>Author of <i>Masters of the Chess Board</i> (1933), which delves into the development of chess and the openings.</p>

        <h2>Siegbert Tarrasch</h2>
